# PacManMCTS
As part of Computer Intelligence in Games course, I have developed an AI agent for Ms Pac-Man and ghosts. The Ms. Pac-Man agent used MCTS and greedy method evade ghost and maximize points. The ghosts used message based coordination in which the nearest ghost always attacked the Pac-Man and other ghosts navigates to Pac-Man's neighboring nodes. Constant values used for reward calculation was optimized using genetic algorithm.

The Pac-Man AI agent went on win 5th position among 23 teams developed by course participants and 9th position(Team ShMaRaSi) in among 28 teams in IEEE CIG 2017 international competition (http://www.pacmanvghosts.co.uk/results.html).
